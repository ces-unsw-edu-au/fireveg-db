## Entity Relationship Diagrams

Ada had a go at a large diagram but has to be edited online.

We can create shareable, textbased Entity Relationship Diagrams using [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) but customising colours is not straightforward:

- https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/2673
- https://codepen.io/huynhicode/pen/eYLqmQJ

Other options include ERD format (`.er` files)  or the bigER modeling tool (`.erd` files).
